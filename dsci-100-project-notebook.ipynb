The cells will have \"%%% EDIT THIS MARKDOWN CELL %%%\" or \"### EDIT THIS CODE CELL ###\" prompting you to overwrite the contents of the cell with your answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Students are required to use methods discussed in DSCI 100 for the project report. However, there may be some stages where you wish to research on how to handle \"messy\" data, including outliers, missing data, etc. **If you refer to anything beyond DSCI 100, please include a link to the reference at the end of this report**. It does not need to be a \"formal\" reference like an academic paper or website, you can link to blog posts or websites like StackExchange if they are relevant to your analysis. \n",

    "## GENERATIVE AI USE\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is based on methods learned in DSCI 100, so you should have all of the tools you need to write this code from scratch. You may use Generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) as an \"advanced search engine\" (i.e., to help de-bug code).**You cannot use it to generate code or text on the report. Any use of Generative AI must be disclosed at the bottom of this project report**. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a disclosure of appropriate Gen AI use: *\"I tried to fit a model using function X and got error Y. Gen AI helped me figure out that the error was due to a missing value.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Failure to disclose Generative AI use is a form of academic misconduct. Submissions suspected of inappropriately using Gen AI will be flagged by the teaching team and handled on a case-by-case basis.**\n",
